The following is a manual on how to get the application up and running, as well as how to use its functionality.

Firstly, Make sure all dependencies are installed. 

## Home page
The home page is where you will choose to either sign in or sign up

### Signing in
you could try out the following accounts:

for doctor:
* email: younis@gmail.com
* password: 123456

for patient:
* email: ziadmf2019@gmail.com
* password: 123456

### Signing up
just make sure when signing up as a doctor to pick out an assigned doctor. for the prototype, we are experimenting with assigning just one doctor to each patient to coordinate the chat feature and the meds adjustment from the doctor's side, but this will bee expanded in the future to allow a limitless number of doctors assigned per patient.

# Doctor side
Due to a short preperation time, currently only the current patients button is functioning, but the other ones will be up and running soon.

The video shows how doctors could interact with patients, showing their meds and having the ability to either add to them, or remove specific medications entirely. We plan on viewing the patient's medical history as well, so that with one tap a doctor has all relevent information at hand.

The message icon on the right of a patient taps into the chat between the doctor and said patient.

# Patient side

Patients have access to their meds on the main page, with the abillity to set an alarm to any of them, as well as access said medication's pamphlet(future feature). 

The appointments part manages all apointments viewing and booking. We plan on integrating the Google maps API in the future to enable a search by doctors' location and proximity.

The profile page is where the user can manage all info that appears to their doctors.

And finally, the chat feature that enables texting doctors, delivering a more personalized approach to healthcare.
